# RoadStatus
Building the code:  

I have marked the repo as Public so either clone the code or download as a zip file from the master branch.
.net core 8 SDK is used.  

      - Restore the dependencies
      - update the app settings.json with the appkey. now it is blank.

## How to build  

  From the root run,  
      dotnet build
